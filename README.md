This is a work in progress and more items will be added with time:

* Synthetic dataset. These images can be generated using code in this repository (```synthetic_data_generation.py```) or directly downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3381498.
* Colorectal (CRC) dataset. To be announced soon.
